        <p class="govuk-body">
            The gender pay gap (GPG) data that you have reported provides a basic understanding of what the gender 
            pay balance looks like within your organisation. However, to be able to target resources effectively to 
            improve your GPG, it is essential to know more about the specific causes of any imbalance.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            In this guide, you will find eight key questions to ask that will help you to identify different potential 
            causes of the GPG. You will need some additional data to be able to be able to answer these questions, but
            you may already collect this data as part of your human resources processes.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            As 77% of organisations reporting in 2017/18 have a gender pay gap in favour of men, this guidance mostly 
            refers to actions to support women. However, the majority of actions could equally be used to support men 
            where the GPG is in favour of women.
