        <p class="govuk-body">
            Performance management scores can give you an indication of whether women and men are performing 
            differently or being assessed differently. If there is a difference between performance scores,
            this can impact progression.
        </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If possible, break them down by grade and job, particularly if performance management approaches 
                    vary between these groups.

                    If your organisation asks employees to provide a self-assessment of their performance, examine it

                    Some research suggests that women tend to rate themselves lower than men and that men are

                        For example, are they being assigned different types of projects that might not equally

                        Consider removing self-assessments from the performance management processes. If you are unable
                        to do this, ensure that managers do not see their employee’s self-assessment before assigning 
                        a final performance score. This makes sure their score isn’t influenced by the employee’s 
                        self-assessment score.
