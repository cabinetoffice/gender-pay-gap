            More women than men work part‐time because most caring responsibilities within the home are still taken
            on by women. Ensuring that part-time employees are well supported and are given opportunities to progress
            means that well-qualified, experienced women (and men who also take on caring responsibilities) are better
            able to keep participating in the workforce.

                    It may be the case, for example, that senior roles are not being made accessible

                    For example, you could look at differences in performance scores and promotion rates between
