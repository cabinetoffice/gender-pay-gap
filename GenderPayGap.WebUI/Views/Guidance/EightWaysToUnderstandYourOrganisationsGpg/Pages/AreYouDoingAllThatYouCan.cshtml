            More women than men work part‐time because most caring responsibilities within the home are still taken
            on by women. Ensuring that part-time employees are well supported and are given opportunities to progress
            means that well-qualified, experienced women (and men who also take on caring responsibilities) are better
            able to keep participating in the workforce.
