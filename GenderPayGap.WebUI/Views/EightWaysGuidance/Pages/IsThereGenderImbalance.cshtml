<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Is there a gender imbalance in your promotions?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
    To avoid gender imbalances higher up in your organisation, men and women need to apply for promotion in
    proportions that match the composition of men and women at grades below. For example, in a particular
    grade you might have 60% women and 40% men. In that case, the pool of candidates who apply for promotion
    from that grade to a more senior grade should also be 60% women and 40% men. If, for example, only 20% of
    the applicants were women, the gender imbalance would be more likely to worsen at the higher grade, meaning
    fewer women in senior roles and a bigger gender pay gap.
</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Identifying gender imbalances within your promotion process</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
    To identify whether this is an issue in your organisation, look at the proportion of women from a given
    grade or role applying for promotions, making it through to any assessment stage or shortlist, and being
    selected for promotion. Is this proportion lower than you would expect, given the proportion of women at
    that grade or in that role?
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    If you have internal recruitment processes (such as those where employees apply to open vacancies),
    look at these processes separately to see if there are any imbalances as candidates progress through
    the stages.
