        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels, zoom and fonts</li>
            <li>complete tasks without a mouse by using input controls such as speech or a keyboard</li>
            <li>listen using a screen reader</li>

            Technical information about this website’s accessibility
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The Government Equalities Office is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to ‘the non-compliances’, listed below.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
            Non-accessible content
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
        </h3>

            <li>the highlighted yellow colour of text boxes has the incorrect colour ratio and is hard to see. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.11 ‘Non-text Contrast’.</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            We aim to fix this issue by the end of 2020.

            Disproportionate burden
        </h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            We have not yet identified a part of the service where it would be a disproportionate burden on the Government Equalities Office to resolve the non-compliance. If this becomes the case, we will publish full details here explaining our decision.
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
            How we tested
        </h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Testing has been conducted internally by Government Equalities Office staff and externally audited by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a>. Where they have been checked for compliance, it has been against WCAG 2.1 AA.
