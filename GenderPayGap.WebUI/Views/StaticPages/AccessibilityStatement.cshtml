            This service is run by the Government Equalities Office (GEO).
            We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
            For example, that means you should be able to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without problems</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>use most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>

                on some pages, content has not been semantically marked-up so that information and relationships  are

            </li>
            <li>
                the search button is slightly pixelated on magnification - this fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1

                there are links on the ‘compare employers’ page that visually look like tabs but have not been marked
                up in this way - this fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.3 (focus order) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value)

                the layout and structure of some elements on the ‘employer report’ page are difficult for screen

            We did accessibility testing ourselves while we developed the service.
