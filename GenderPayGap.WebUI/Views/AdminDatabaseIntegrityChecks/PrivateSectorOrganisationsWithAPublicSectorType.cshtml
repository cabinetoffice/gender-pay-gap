    This shows active private organisations, that are either in scope or presumed in scope, with a public sector 
    type already which should not happen. They need investigating to understand why this has occurred (possibly 
    because the organisation was incorrectly created as a public one for instance). This needs resolving as otherwise 
    the management information around deadline will be incorrect.
