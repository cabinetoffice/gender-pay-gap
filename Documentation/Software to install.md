## Software to install
Install the following software:
* An IDE eg.
  * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) + [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)  
    If you work for Softwire, read Softwire's guides about getting
    [licences for Visual Studio](https://swiki.softwire.com/display/Helpdesk/Visual+Studio) and
    [licences for ReSharper](https://swiki.softwire.com/display/Helpdesk/JetBrains+Licence+Keys)

  * [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)  
    If you work for Softwire, read Softwire's guide about getting
    [licences for Rider](https://swiki.softwire.com/display/Helpdesk/JetBrains+Licence+Keys)

* Git
  * [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

  * [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is really nice!  
    If you work for Softwire, read Softwire's guide about getting
    [licences for GitKraken](https://swiki.softwire.com/display/Helpdesk/GitKraken)
    (although you should be able to use the free version for this project, because it's an open-source repo)

* .Net Core SDK  
  Here's the [direct link to the .Net Core SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.402-windows-x64-installer)

* Postgres  
  The latest version should be fine  
  [Download Postgres for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)  
  **Note:** remember the username / password that you set during installation, you'll need it later!

* A database UI  
  I'd recommend [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)  
  You ccan use pgAdmin (which comes with Postgres), but DataGrip is better (in my opinion)  
  If you work for Softwire, read Softwire's guide about getting
  [licences for DataGrip](https://swiki.softwire.com/display/Helpdesk/JetBrains+Licence+Keys)

* Node Package Manger (NPM) (comes with Node.js)  
  [Download Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  If you're using Windows, you probably want to download the LTS installer from that page
