# Accounts you will need to develop the Gender Pay gap service

You will need access to the following systems to develop the Gender Pay Gap service.
Ask an existing member of the team to add you to all of these.

The code:
* Write access to this GitHub repository  
  Normally granted by adding you to the
  [Gender Pay Gap GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/cabinetoffice/teams/gender-pay-gap)

Services that the Gender Pay Gap service depends on:
* [Gov.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/)  
  Here's a link to the [Gender Pay Gap service on Gov.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/services/58538018-48c7-4dcc-b33e-58492646d371)

* Google Analytics  
  You'll need a Google Account (not necessarily a Gmail account) using your work email address  
  You can [get a Google Account here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
  (click "Use my current email address instead" to avoid creating a new gmail account)

Deploying / hosting the service:
* Build / release pipelines:  
  [govtequalitiesoffice/Gender Pay Gap project on Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/govtequalitiesoffice/Gender%20Pay%20Gap)

  that you'll need to be added to

Monitoring the service:
* We use [Logit.io](https://logit.io/) for logging
* We use [Grafana](https://gpg-grafana.london.cloudapps.digital/) for metrics / monitoring

Project tools:

  This is our main ticketing system

  Used for storing user research (insights / hypotheses / etc.)

* [Miro](https://miro.com)  
  For user research planning

  This can be useful to ask questions to the Design System and PaaS teams
